		<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of
			performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include understanding natural
			language, recognizing patterns in data, making decisions, and solving problems. AI aims to simulate human
			cognitive abilities such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

			<h2>Mashine Learning:</h2>
			<div class="point"> A subset of AI where algorithms learn from data and improve over time without
			explicit programming. It includes techniques like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and
			reinforcement learning. </div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Deep Learning:</h2> 
			<div class="point"> A specialized form of machine learning inspired by the structure and function of the
			human brain's neural networks. Deep learning algorithms process data through layers of interconnected nodes
			(neurons) to recognize patterns and make decisions. </div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Natural Language Processing (NLP): </h2>
			<div class="point"> AI techniques that enable machines to understand, interpret, and
			generate human language in a way that is meaningful. NLP powers applications like speech recognition,
			language translation, and sentiment analysis.</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Computer Vision:</h2> 
			<div class="point">AI algorithms that enable machines to interpret and understand visual information
			from the world, including images and videos. Computer vision is used in tasks such as object recognition,
			facial recognition, and autonomous driving. </div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Robotics:</h2> 
			<div class="point"> AI applied to physical systems, enabling robots and autonomous systems to perceive their
			environment, make decisions, and execute tasks. Robotics integrates AI with sensors, actuators, and control
			systems to perform tasks in various domains such as manufacturing, healthcare, and exploration. </div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Expert Systems: </h2> 
			<div class="point"> AI systems designed to emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert in a
			specific domain. These systems use rules and knowledge bases to provide advice or solve problems that
			typically require human expertise. </div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2> Application Aross Industries: </h2> 
			<div class="point">AI is used in diverse sectors including healthcare (medical
			diagnosis, personalized treatment), finance (algorithmic trading, fraud detection), retail (recommendation
			systems, supply chain optimization), and entertainment (gaming AI, content recommendation). </div>
